# Landing-Page
First ever landing page,hopefully I complete it soon and commit often.

Hello, its 26th June 2022 and I've started working on the second TOP Project: Landing Page. I think I'm also going to use this for the DBMS Project so I save time.

Added header today, hopefully "why helpdesks are necessary" tomorrow.

Update: It's 28/06/22 and it's officially completed. :)
