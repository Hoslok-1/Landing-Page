It found that value was derived not only from a reactive response to user issues, but also from the help desk's unique position of communicating daily with numerous customers or employees. Information gained in areas such as technical problems, user preferences, and satisfaction can be valuable for the planning and development work of other information technology units.</div>

                <p>Help Request Acceptance</p>Help desk teams handle requests in real time that customers or other authorized users submit by email, phone or messaging apps.
            </div>
            <div class = "card"><p>Ticket Creation</p>Staff use help desk software to create help desk tickets that track customer support When an initial call can't be resolved immediately, help desk staff use the ticketing system to make sure customer requests are resolved in a timely fashion.</div>
            <div class ="card"><p>Ticket Management</p>Either a person or software routes help tickets to the right help desk Help desk ticketing software is designed to ensure that service requests are routed to the right service teams.</div>
            <div class ="card"><p>Escalation</p>When the customer support professional can't resolve a request, the next step is to route the ticket to another team member or escalate it to a next tier level. Escalation of a ticket should only occur after initially responding service desk staffers exhaust their own resources for solving a customer problem.</div>
            <div class = "card"><p>Knowledge Base</p>Help desk staff use a help desk knowledge base to discover whether a customer issue has already been identified and, if so, what the resolution was. Staff should be able to add and update content in the knowledge base as they uncover novel customer requests.</div>
